# Thursday ceremony
Close family and friends are invited to join us for a small wedding ceremony at our home on Thursday, August 12th. This date will be our anniversary. We chose this date to honor Craig's beloved father Jim, who was born on August 12th and passed away nearly one year ago.

Arrive at 12:30 PM for drinks and mingling, ceremony at 1 PM followed by lunch.

Kirkwood School Lofts, 138 Kirkwood Rd NE, Atlanta GA 30317.

Park on the street and enter through the gate on Kirkwood Rd near Robson Pl (look for the white columns). Those with limited mobility can enter through the gate at 1995 Warlick Pl NE, Atlanta GA 30317. Park in the lot to the lower right and call Pearl (207-664-8232) for help getting to the ceremony location.

We'll have limited space at lunch and may need to limit attendees to the first who respond. But don't worry, you can see us at the Friday rehearsal, Saturday main event, and Sunday brunch!

Lunch will have vegetarian and vegan options and be catered by Pearl's good friend, personal chef Michelle Skalka ([Clean Plate Club](https://www.cleanplateclubatl.com/), with assistance from friend Amy Marti).

# Friday rehearsal
For those involved in the wedding ceremony, please join us at 5 PM at the Kirkwood School Lofts for a rehearsal of the main event. Location and parking details available on the [main wedding site](https://pearlryder.github.io/wedding/#the-short-and-sweet-version).

# Rehearsal dinner
