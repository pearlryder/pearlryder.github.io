# Thursday ceremony
Close family and friends are invited to join us for a small wedding ceremony at our home on Thursday, August 12th. This date will be our anniversary. We chose this date to honor Craig's beloved father Jim, who was born on August 12th and passed away nearly one year ago.

After a short ceremony, we'll enjoy a lunch with vegetarian and vegan options catered by Pearl's good friend, personal chef Michelle Skalka ([Clean Plate Club](https://www.cleanplateclubatl.com/), with assistance from friend Amy Marti).

# Friday rehearsal
For those involved in the wedding ceremony, please join us at 5 PM at the Kirkwood School Lofts for a rehearsal of the main event. Location and parking details available on the (main wedding site)[https://pearlryder.github.io/wedding/#the-short-and-sweet-version].

# Rehearsal dinner
Close friends and family are invited to join us for the rehearsal dinner at [Herban Fix](http://herbanfix.com/), a restaurant in downtown Atlanta. Free parking is available inside the garage on Linden Ave.
