# The short and sweet version
If you're ready to go with the flow, then here's the short and sweet of what you need to know:


**Saturday, August 14, 2021**

**5 PM, Kirkwood School Lofts**

*Ecuadorian guests should plan on arriving at 3pm*

*Gates open at 4:30 PM*

Please park on the street and then enter through the car gate at [1995 Warlick Pl NE, Atlanta, GA 30317](https://goo.gl/maps/vFvF8z7QBt2jmZpP9). Bike parking will be located along the fence to the right of the field. Those with limited mobility may drive through the gate and park in the gravel lot to the lower right.

After the ceremony, bike (encouraged!) or drive to [Trees Atlanta, 225 Chester Ave SE, Atlanta, GA 30316](https://goo.gl/maps/hAoKfHWKRCh2rFpR7). There will be a bike valet in the parking lot behind Trees Atlanta. Those driving can park at the [Atlanta Habitat for Humanity ReStore](https://goo.gl/maps/sZvQhqQTCL2RU83d8) next door to Trees Atlanta and walk over. Anyone with limited mobility can park in the parking lot behind Trees Atlanta.

# Ceremony
Our ceremony will begin at 5 PM on Saturday evening. Prepare for heat! We'll have cold non-alcoholic drinks and hand fans to try to help everyone stay cool.

# Bike parade
After the ceremony, we'll gather our belongings and parade to the reception, about 2.2 miles away. The route is available [here](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=7602781). Drivers are encouraged to drive behind the cyclists (carefully!).

# Reception
After a cold drink and snack at Trees Atlanta, we'll dine on Caribbean food from Chelsea's Vegetarian Restaurant (vegan and vegetarian options) and then spend the night dancing. Dessert will be pie from [Evergreen Butcher and Baker](https://www.evergreenbutcherandbaker.com/).

# Cookie exchange
For those local to Atlanta, please consider bringing a plate of cookies to share! All guests are encouraged to prepare a selection of cookies to bring home and enjoy.  

# Sunday brunch
Everyone is invited to brunch at our home at the Kirkwood School Lofts on Sunday morning! Please drop in when you can. 10 AM - 2 PM. For parking info, refer to [the short and sweet info](#the-short-and-sweet-version). Brunch will include vegan options and be served from the [Rising Son restaurant](https://www.risingsonavondale.com/)

# Vaccine

COVID-19 vaccination of each vaccine-eligible guest is mandatory for our wedding.

# Attire

Festive attire is encouraged for the ceremony and reception, but wear whatever you want! Just don't upstage us. If you're biking to the event (which you should) don't forget to consider leg mobility/fabric looseness when planning your attire.

# Gifts
Your presence is gift enough. We are not gifty people and would prefer not to receive physical gifts (unless they're edible).

If you would like to give us a gift (and it is entirely your choice), we prefer one of these options:

1. Make a donation to [Concrete-Jungle](https://www.concrete-jungle.org/), a non-profit started by Craig and his friends to rescue abandoned fruit and vegetables to share with those in need.
2. For those local to Atlanta, please consider bringing a plate of cookies! We'll have a cookie room at Trees Atlanta where all our guests can make their own cookie medley to bring home at the end of the evening (plus cookies to eat while you're there)

# RSVP

We need to know if you're coming! [Répondez s'il vous plaît](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHMGkYJDAFl4x0VJfo1EyQyeg-4wOVq3fyrA0bNBwsPj2XbQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
