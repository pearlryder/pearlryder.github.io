Festive attire encouraged, but wear whatever you want! Just don't upstage us. If you're biking to the event (which you should) don't forget to consider leg mobility/fabric looseness when planning your attire.

# Vaccine

***Special promotion!*** Present your vaccination card to receive one (1) free night of eating and dancing with your friends and family. Unbeatable value!

(COVID-19 vaccination of each vaccine-eligible guest is mandatory for our wedding.)

# Gifts
Your presence is gift enough. We are not gifty people and would prefer not to receive physical gifts (unless they're edible).

If you would like to give us a gift (and it is entirely your choice), we prefer one of these options:

1. Make a donation to [Concrete-Jungle](https://www.concrete-jungle.org/), a non-profit started by Craig and his friends to rescue abandoned fruit and vegetables to share with those in need.
2. For those local to Atlanta, please consider bringing a plate of cookies! We'll have a cookie room at Trees Atlanta where all our guests can make their own cookie medley to bring home at the end of the evening (plus cookies to eat while you're there)

# RSVP

We need to know if you're coming! [Répondez s'il vous plaît](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHMGkYJDAFl4x0VJfo1EyQyeg-4wOVq3fyrA0bNBwsPj2XbQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
