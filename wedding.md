# Gifts
Your presence is gift enough! We are not gifty people and would prefer not to receive physical gifts (unless they're edible).

If you would like to give us a gift (and it is entirely your choice), we prefer one of these options:

1. Make a donation to [Concrete-Jungle](https://www.concrete-jungle.org/), a non profit started by Craig and his friends to rescue abandoned fruit and vegetables to share with those in need.
2. We love homemade art / crafts! Break out the finger paints and make us something to celebrate and remember our wedding.
3. For those local to Atlanta, please consider bringing a plate of cookies! We'll have a cookie room at Trees Atlanta where all our guests can make their own cookie medley to bring home at the end of the evening (plus unlimited cookies while you're there)
