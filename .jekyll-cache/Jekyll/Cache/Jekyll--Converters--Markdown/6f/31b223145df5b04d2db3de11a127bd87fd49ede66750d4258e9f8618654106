I"º<p>Yesterday I started <a href="https://brooksann.com/">Brooks Ann Camperâ€™s</a> Skirt Skills <a href="https://learnwithbrooksann.com/skirt-skills/">course</a>, which is an introduction to custom, slow sewing. Last fall, Iâ€™d heard from multiple friends in Jennifer Wieseâ€™s <a href="https://workroomsocial.com/">Workroom Social Sewists</a> group that the Skirt Skills course revolutionized their ideas about their bodies, garment fit, and construction. After about 3 years of sewing (I started up in late December 2020 â€“ very much a pandemic hobby in that winter pre-vaccination where we had A LOT of time at home and I needed something to do with my hands), I had reached a point where I felt comfortable adapting patterns to my body but I wanted to dive deeper and level up my construction skills. Around the same time, I listened to Brooks Ann talk about her sewing journey on the <a href="https://lovetosewpodcast.com/episodes/episode-56-hand-sewing-with-brooks-ann-camper/?mc_cid=d89a80bf63">Love to Sew Podcast</a> and I was electrified by how strongly I identified with her approach to sewing and custom garment creation. â€œThatâ€™s what I want to be doing!â€, I thought. And so, here I am.</p>
