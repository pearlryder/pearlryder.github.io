<figcaption>Sketching a skirt with a cup of coffee is a wonderful quiet moment at the beginning of my day.

Design ideas so far: I really am drawn to wool right now, probably because it's cold in Atlanta and my sewing space. That's reflected in my [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/pearlryder/skirt-skills-inspo/), which I've built so far with pure crow brain (just grab whatever appeals in any way) over two 10 minute sessions. This skirt will be completed in probably March-April, which means warmth here (70s-80s temps) so I'm going to turn on the space heater and look for more summery styles in the next few Pinterest sessions.

A couple of croquis pose thoughts. I like having my knees facing toward the camera. It makes it easier for me to draw fabric drape -- more neutral. And wearing shoes is so much better than weird sock feet! That said, the next time I take photos for the croquis, I want to make extra sure that my camera is level and pointing at my body from the most neutral angle -- there's possibly something weird going on with camera angles and my shape for the photo that is the basis of the outline below. I think there might be a bit of downward tilt to the camera. Time will tell.

This morning I "tried on" a trumpet skirt on my custom croquis and was surprised at how much I liked the silhouette on my shape. It was a surprise to be surprised. Neat!
