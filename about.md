I am a computational biologist focused on extracting meaningful data from biological images. I work at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) in the [Imaging Platform aka Carpenter Lab](https://carpenterlab.broadinstitute.org/) as a postdoctoral fellow in bioimage analysis. My work is funded by the [Center for Open Bioimage Analysis](https://openbioimageanalysis.org/), which aims to improve access to quantitative methods.

I previously worked in the [Lerit Laboratory](http://cellbio.emory.edu/faculty-profiles/primary/lerit-dorothy.html) as a post-doctoral fellow in the [Department of Cell Biology](http://cellbio.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I'm an alumna of the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), the [Emory University Medical Scientist Training Program](https://med.emory.edu/MDPHD/), the [MBL Physiology Course](http://www.mbl.edu/physiology/), and Emory's [Fellowships for Research and Science Teaching (FIRST) Program](http://www.biology.emory.edu/first/).
