### Pearl Ryder, MD, PhD

I am a cell biologist focused on the structure and dynamics of centrosomes using the fruit fly as a model system. As a quantitative cell biologist, I apply the Python libraries pandas, numpy, scipy, and CV2 coupled with SQL to glean biologically relevant data from high resolution microscopy images.

I work within the [Lerit Laboratory](http://cellbio.emory.edu/faculty-profiles/primary/lerit-dorothy.html) as a post-doctoral fellow in the [Department of Cell Biology](http://cellbio.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I'm an alumna of the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), the [Emory University Medical Scientist Training Program](https://med.emory.edu/MDPHD/), and the [MBL Physiology Course](http://www.mbl.edu/physiology/).

 I am also a fellow in the [Fellowships for Research and Science Teaching (FIRST) Program](http://physiology.emory.edu/first/) at Emory University and the Atlanta University Center and a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Fellow.
