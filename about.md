I am a data scientist / software engineer / get-things-done person who works at [Wandrer](https://wandrer.earth) with my husband [Craig](https://www.highcube.org/). Previously, I worked as a computational biologist focused on extracting meaningful data from biological images at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) in the [Cimini Lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/).

Before that, I worked in the [Lerit Laboratory](http://cellbio.emory.edu/faculty-profiles/primary/lerit-dorothy.html) as a post-doctoral fellow in the [Department of Cell Biology](http://cellbio.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I'm an alumna of the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), the [Emory University Medical Scientist Training Program](https://med.emory.edu/MDPHD/), the [MBL Physiology Course](http://www.mbl.edu/physiology/), and Emory's [Fellowships for Research and Science Teaching (FIRST) Program](http://www.biology.emory.edu/first/).
